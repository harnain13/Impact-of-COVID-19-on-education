# Education Dataset Covid-19 Analysis

### Overview:
The project aimed to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students' experiences with online classes using survey data. The dataset used for analysis can be found on Kaggle: [COVID-19 Impact on Students](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kunal28chaturvedi/covid19-and-its-impact-on-students).
The dataset includes various types of variables:
- Continuous variables: online class time, self-study time, fitness time, sleep time, social media time, TV time
- Ordinal variables: rating of class experience, change in weight
- Categorical variables: region, medium, social media platform
- Binary variables and open-response variables categorized manually.

### Evaluation of Results:
- Bayesian Belief Network analysis focused on relationships between wellness behaviors (sleep and fitness), class commitment (class time and study time), and distractions (social media and TV time) across age groups (7-17 and 18-27).
- Conditional probability tables were generated to assess behavioral factors.

### Insights:
- Detailed insights were derived regarding sleep patterns, fitness engagement, media usage, and their impact on class commitment across different age groups.
- Contradictory findings compared to existing studies were noted, suggesting potential areas for further research.

### Conclusion:
This project provides valuable insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced students' educational experiences, focusing on online learning and its associated behaviors. The findings underscore the complex interplay between sleep, fitness, media use, and academic commitment across different age demographics.
